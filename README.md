Right click Main.kt and click "Run MainKt" and Intellij will take care of the Configuration setup for you.

Note: [Openjdk doesnt include JavaFx by default](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52467561/intellij-cant-recognize-javafx-11-with-openjdk-11), so you will have to install it seperately on you machine.
